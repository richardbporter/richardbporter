### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Richard B. Porter. For over a decade, I've been doing all things Drupal with a little DevOps mixed in as well. Most of the time, I'm here on [GitHub](https://github.com/richardbporter) or [drupal.org](https://drupal.org/u/richardbporter) but on the rare occasion, I [tweet](https://twitter.com/richardbporter) things (mostly soccer). âš½ 

Cheers!
